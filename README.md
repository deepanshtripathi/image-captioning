The combination of text and image understanding has opened
up exciting possibilities in the field of artificial intelligence. The
ability to describe images in natural language is a fascinating
field that has many uses, such as helping people who are blind,
improving search engines, and making content creation more
interesting. The goal of this project is to make an AI-powered
image captioning model that can help people understand both
what they see and what they read.
